# chess-minimax

Objective: create an intelligent agent to play chess against using the minimax algorithm 

Details: 
- I love to play chess in my free time, so I thought this would be a fun personal project!
- I was exposed to basic game theory, including the minimax algorithm and associated optimization strategies, during my time in Georgia Tech's Artificial Intelligence course
- currently, the player references an openings database (~10,000 lines/variations). once opening theory is exhausted, the minimax algorithm is called
- still a work in progress... I need to go back and fix a few things (move choice logic for minimax algorithm, improved scoring, better function structure, more comments, etc.)
