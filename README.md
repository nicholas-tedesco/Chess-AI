# chess-minimax

Objective: create an intelligent agent to play chess against using the minimax algorithm 

Details: 
- I love to play chess in my free time, so I thought this would be a fun personal project!
- I was exposed to basic game theory, including the minimax algorithm and associated optimization strategies, during my time in Georgia Tech's Artificial Intelligence course
- I plan on designing an algorithm from scratch (but perhaps with some assistance from other projects - will cite as applicable) that utilizes minimax theory, as well as optimizations including alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening
- more to come soon !!
